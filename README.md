# docker-moin

Deploy a moinmoin wiki using Docker.

## Setup

In `nginx/moinmoin.conf`, configure the server name (`s/example.com/your_domain_name_here/g`).

In `moinmoin/wikiconfig.py`, configure the wiki name (`s/Untitled Wiki/your_wiki_name_here`). Also configure the security section to suit your needs.

{{{
    # Security ----------------------------------------------------------

    # This is checked by some rather critical and potentially harmful actions,
    # like despam or PackageInstaller action:
    superuser = [u"your_name_here"]

    # Some actions are by default only enabled for superusers and disabled
    # for everybody else.
    # 'newaccount' is one of these (used to let visitors create new accounts).
    # You can create wiki users on the shell by using "moin account create".
    # A superuser also can use "Settings" -> "Switch user" to create users.
    # If you need the newaccount action for everybody (e.g. to create your
    # very first [superuser] account), you can (temporarily) enable it:
    #actions_superuser = multiconfig.DefaultConfig.actions_superuser[:]
    #actions_superuser.remove('newaccount')

    # IMPORTANT: grant yourself admin rights! replace YourName with
    # your user name. See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more help.
    # All acl_rights_xxx options must use unicode [Unicode]
    acl_rights_before = u"your_name_here:read,write,delete,revert,admin"

    # This is the default ACL that applies to pages without an ACL.
    # Adapt it to your needs, consider using an EditorGroup.
    acl_rights_default = u"Trusted:read,write,delete,revert Known:read,write,delete,revert All:read"

    # The default (ENABLED) password_checker will keep users from choosing too
    # short or too easy passwords. If you don't like this and your site has
    # rather low security requirements, feel free to DISABLE the checker by:
    #password_checker = None # None means "don't do any password strength checks"

    # Link spam protection for public wikis (Uncomment to enable)
    # Needs a reliable internet connection.
    #from MoinMoin.security.antispam import SecurityPolicy

The web server will be accessible on port 8080.
